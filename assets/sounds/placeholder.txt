This directory is intended to hold sound files.
Please add a 'ringing.mp3' file here for the call ringing sound to work.
You can find free ringing sounds online from sites like Pixabay, Mixkit, etc. Ensure you respect any licensing terms.
Example file name: ringing.mp3
Make sure this file is placed in `public/assets/sounds/ringing.mp3` or adjust the path in CallContext.tsx.
For the current setup, it should be in `public/assets/sounds/ringing.mp3` if `public` is the root for static assets.
If your build process moves assets differently, ensure the path `'/assets/sounds/ringing.mp3'` in `CallContext.tsx` correctly points to the served file.
